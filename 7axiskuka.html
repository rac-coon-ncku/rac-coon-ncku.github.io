            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Developed for the manufacturing industry as process-agnostic
                positioning devices, industrial robots are highly flexible machines capable of quickly introducing
                precision and repeatability to a near-infinite number of processes. Current research into their
                architectural implications leverage this notion, interrogating the expanded intersection of the
                material and formal domains allowed through their use.
                The FABLab has three robotic workcells at its disposal: the first is located in the High Bay and
                contains two KUKA KR-120 industrial robots mounted on linear axes; the other two workcells can be
                found in room 1205 and is composed of two stationary KUKA KR-60 industrial robots and two stationary
                KUKA KR-6 industrial robots.</p>
            <h3>ACCESS PROCEDURE</h3>
            <p>Every M.Arch student is introduced to robotic processes through the required course ARCH537. Due to
                the time associated with learning to the use the robots, their use is primarily limited to projects
                associated with dedicated coursework taught in the FABLab. If you have an individual job that you
                feel requires the robots, contact the FABLab Staff to discuss the application and possible next
                steps.
                Typically, students first learn to use the smallest KUKA KR-6 industrial robots, which allows them
                to eventually move to the larger robotic workcells. Tooling and established processes become more
                complex with the larger workcells, but the controls and programming are similar. Due to the
                complexity of kinematics, there is no simple answer for how large a workpiece can be; in general is
                must fall within the maximum physical limits of the robotic arm.</p>
            <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>The material capabilities of the robots are largely determined by their tooling, often developed
                around a specific material manipulation or research trajectory. Past projects have been successfully
                developed about working with wood veneer, sheet metal, metal rod, plaster, stone, glass, and
                thermoplast polymers.</p>
